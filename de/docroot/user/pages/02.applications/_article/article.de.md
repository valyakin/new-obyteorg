        <h2>Risk-free conditional payments</h2>
        <p>
            Obyte allows you to do something that traditional currencies can't: <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/obyte/making-p2p-great-again-fe9e20546a4a">conditional payments</a>.
            You set a condition when the payee receives the money. If the condition is not met, you get your money back.
        </p>
       <p>For example, you want to exchange 100 A-tokens for 10 B-tokens. You send 100 A-tokens to the peer and set a condition "the peer can receive A-tokens only once I receive 10 B-tokens". The A-tokens are temporarily locked on a smart contract that exists between you and the peer, and the peer can't take A-tokens before he fulfils his part of the deal. He sends B-tokens to you, then he is able to unlock A-tokens from the contract.</p>

        </p>

        <h2>P2P insurance</h2>
        <p>You can hedge against negative events if you find a peer who is willing to bet on the event not happening.</p>
        <p>Insurance is just a simple smart contract that can be unlocked by the insured — if the event in question did occur, or by the insurer — otherwise.</p>
        <p>Creating a contract is available in Obyte wallet, no programming skills are required. Chat with the peer, click his address in chat, select "offer a contract", and fill a form. This is what human-readable/human-writable smart contract looks like. The peer will be able to view the contract and accept it with one click.</p>
        <p>If you want to buy flight delay insurance from a bot, find the corresponding bot in the Bot Store in the wallet and the bot will guide you through the process of smart contract creation.</p>

        <h2>Prediction markets</h2>
        <p>Make money by correctly predicting future events.</p>
        <p>You bet that a specific event will happen, your peer bets on the event not happening. You can make P2P bets on e.g. price movements, sports, weather, or political events.</p>
        <p>Like in P2P insurance above, create a human-readable/human-writable smart contract in your wallet and offer it to the peer.</p>
        <p>If you want to bet against a bot, find Sports betting bot in the Bot Store in your wallet and browse the upcoming sports events. You can also be a bookmaker and create bets for others to accept.</p>
