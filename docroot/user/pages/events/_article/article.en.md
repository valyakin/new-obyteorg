            Obyte was very proud to be invited again to participate as a key technology provider in the second Annual Hackathon sponsored by the Bosch Connectory in Stuttgart, Germany. 40 developers from Bosch and selected partners joined the event and worked on 7 different challenges, the solutions for 5 of which were powered by Obyte technology. <br> 
            Teams used the Obyte DLT platform to create a vending machine accepting only BoschCoin cryptotokens, a distributed on-demand market place for renting power tools, a decentralized peer to peer energy trading platform, a crypto powered meeting room booking solution, and an Autonomous Agent for a decentralized marketplace with built-in escrow functionality and a dutch auction mechanism.
