            <h2>What is “personally identifiable information?”</h2>
            <p>
                “Personally identifiable information” (“personal information”) is any information that can be directly 
                associated with a particular person and can be used to identify that person. A prime example of 
                identifiable information is a person’s name. In some instances, such as the EU directive, an email or IP 
                address can be viewed as personal information.
