For this help, Obyte rewards the contributors: <b>$1.00</b> in Bytes for every 1,000,000 points contributed.

This is also a way to get a small amount of Bytes without having to buy them on an exchange. It is similar to mining but the computing power is used to solve real world problems.

[Obyte team on WCG](https://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/team/viewTeamInfo.do?teamId=R1RD1XTFK92&target=_blank) is currently one of the top contributors by [results](https://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/stat/viewStatsByTeamY.do?sort=results&target=_blank), [points](https://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/stat/viewStatsByTeamY.do?sort=points&target=_blank), and [total run time](https://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/stat/viewStatsByTeamY.do?sort=cpu&target=_blank), and has contributed over 22,000 years of run time since the program started. We have participated in multiple challenges and won some of them, e.g. [THOR Challenge 2019](https://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/team/challenge/viewTeamChallenge.do?challengeId=9589).
