# Exchanges
You can buy or sell bytes without leaving the wallet by [chatting with a trading bot](obyte:Ar2ukVqx309sX+LoC9RVOpfATgXskt+Ser5jVr3Q2FOo@obyte.org/bb#0000). You can also trade on the exchanges listed below.

To buy or sell blackbytes, use [Blackbytes.io](https://blackbytes.io/?target=_blank) or exchange peer-to-peer using [bound (conditional) payments](https://medium.com/obyte/making-p2p-great-again-fe9e20546a4a?target=_blank) with other users from our [Discord](https://discord.obyte.org/?target=_blank) community.
