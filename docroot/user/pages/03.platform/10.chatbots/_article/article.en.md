# Chat and chatbots

<div class="sub-block">
    In Obyte, payments can be tightly integrated with communications &mdash; through chat.
</div>
<div class="sub-text-block">
    <p>
        Chat is built-in into Obyte wallet and allows to chat both with people and bots and instantly redirect the user to an action that requires the wallet functionality, such as sending a payment, sharing a private profile, signing a contract, etc.
    </p>

    <div class="info-block">
        <p>In addition to the standard text messaging functionality, the chat supports:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>sending payment requests for a specific amount;</li>
            <li>paying the requested amount in two clicks;</li>
            <li>sharing one's address for easy use in payments and contracts;</li>
            <li>sending a payment to the peer's address in a few clicks;</li>
            <li>sharing one's <a href="/platform/identity">private profile</a> or a part thereof;</li>
            <li>requesting a private profile;</li>
            <li>offering a menu of clickable commands for easy navigation;</li>
            <li>sending a vote;</li>
            <li>signing a message;</li>
            <li>requesting to sign a message;</li>
            <li>offering a  <a href="/platform/prosaic-contracts">prosaic contract</a></li>
            <li>accepting a prosaic contract.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These capabilities are most useful for chatbots, which are small apps programmed to give automated responses depending on user input.</p>

        <p>For deveopers, chatbots offer a way to quickly create a simple app without large investment into UI. For end users, chatbots offer a way to quickly start using a new app without investing much time into learning a new user interface.</p>
        <p>Chatbots can be added to the Bot Store which is also built-in in Obyte wallets and is similar to the App Store on iOS or Google Play on Android. The Bot Store enables easy discovery of apps by users and a channel of distribution for app developers.</p>
        <p>Chat messages are end-to-end encrypted using user private keys, therefore, although the messages are relayed through a hub, the hub cannot see their cleartext content.</p>
