## Payment channels
<p class="med-width">
    Iot applications often use <a href="/platform/payment-channels">payment channels</a> to organize streaming payments between two IoT devices or between a user wallet and a IoT device. They can be used e.g. for charging electric vehicles, parking, renting a room, payment for data streams, payment for services such as real time voice recognition, and other machine-to-machine payments.

## Autonomous things
In an environment where:
* IoT devices are equipped with **wallets**;
* the wallets work in an **open** payment system that is easy to join and the payments are fast, cheap, and reliable;
* the payments between unknown IoT devices that don't trust each other are still **safe** thanks to [payment channels](/platform/payment-channels);

in this environment, IoT devices can have economic relations with each other and with people, they can specialize in a few tasks they are designed to do, sell their services to other devices and to people, and buy the services they need. These capabilities make them **autonomous things** that are integrated in value chains and participate in economic life on (almost) equal terms with people.

            For use in very small devices such as ESP32 and ESP8266, Obyte node was rewritten in C/C++ and ported to 
            Arduino platform. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Papabyte/Byteduino">See Byteduino homepage on github</a>.
